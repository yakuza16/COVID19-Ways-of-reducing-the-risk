------------
Website contains slider. Current statistics about all coronavirus cases, recoveries and deaths. The main context of the page was to show some of the most important rules for living in a pandemic era.

This website is made in html, css, OOP Javascript. In JS I used inheritance from other classes.
There are three main classes:
1. Slider class - it holds the logic of the slider.
2. Statistics class - it is fetching worldwide statistics about Coronavirus and public those data.
3. Common class - is the basic class, which holds the basic functions thanks to which we are selecting elements from the Document Object Model.
